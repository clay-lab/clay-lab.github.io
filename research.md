<p>
Members of the CLAY lab study language as a computational system. Questions of focus include:
<ul>
<li>What types of formal mathematical structures can be used to characterize human language at each of its levels of organization (phonology, syntax, semantics, etc.)?</li>
<li>What types of learning biases and learning algorithms can explain how children acquire language so rapidly?</li>
<li>In what ways are AI systems similar to and different from humans in how they process language, and how can we develop technology that is more human-like?</li>
</ul>
The research that we conduct spans multiple disciplines, including theoretical linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. For examples of specific research directions, see our <a href="https://clay.yale.edu/publications">Publications page</a>.
