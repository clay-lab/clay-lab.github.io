      <p align="left"> <div class="left"> This is the website for the
    Computational Linguistics at Yale (CLAY) Lab. CLAY is an
    interdisciplinary research group of faculty, post-docs, and
    students interested in theoretical and applied questions
    related to computational approaches to language learning
    and the processing and representation of linguistic structure. We
    meet every week during the academic year, both to discuss current
    work by lab members and to read recent research papers. </p>

	For information about joining the CLAY lab, contact <a
	href="mailto:bob.frank@yale.edu">Bob Frank</a>.
	
  <p>The CLAY lab is looking to hire a post-doctoral fellow to do exciting interdisciplinary work at the border of theoretical syntax and neural network models of language learning. If this sounds interesting to you, have a look <a href="https://bobfrank1.github.io/postdoc"></a>here</a>.
