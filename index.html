      <p align="left"> <div class="left"> This is the website for the
    Computational Linguistics at Yale (CLAY) Lab. CLAY is an
    interdisciplinary research group of faculty, post-docs, and
    students interested in theoretical and applied questions
    related to computational approaches to language learning
    and the processing and representation of linguistic structure. We
    meet every week during the academic year, both to discuss current
    work by lab members and to read recent research papers. </p>
